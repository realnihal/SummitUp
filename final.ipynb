       "\"Speaker 1: Okay, I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about the program. What exactly goes on? Speaker 0: Okay, well basically it's an intensive program designed to last four weeks. Each session is four weeks long, although we do have two sessions in 1996 that will be two weeks long. But our general four week session involves seven hours of contact each day of Spanish. It involves starting at nine o'clock in the morning with three hours of grammar instruction. And then it's followed immediately by an hour of group conversation with the same instructor, same class. But we have extensive gardens here at the Institute and so students will usually go out to a garden setting because it's a little more comfortable. And then after a break for lunch, students return and we have a complete flip of instruction in that instead of textbook and clinical type instruction, we have hands on. And we offer workshops in Mehe Backstrap leaving regional cooking of Wahaka at Don Pasnell pottery. And if we have large groups, we also offer folkloric dance. And those are two hours a day Monday through Thursday. And they're really in place not so much to teach students a craft, but they're in place to facilitate Spanish language acquisition with a hands-on project. It's our belief that using the language will give students an opportunity to have better retention. You say they use it, they feel a little bit more comfortable, the vocabulary expands and whatnot. And then the last hour is a daily intercombo hour and that's where someone from the community in Wahaka comes to the Institute. They work with one of our students, one-on-one as a conversation partner. And if the students here at the Institute were English speaking, English being their native language, then half the time would be in English, half the time would be in Spanish. And we offer included in the course our lectures, weekly lectures, and we have films and other cultural presentations. And all that is included within the same package. We also offer optional tours on the weekends, going to points of interest around Wahaka. Wahaka, I don't know if you're familiar with Wahaka, but it's really rich with archaeological sites and indigenous marketplaces and craft villages. Speaker 1: There's a lot to see. There's a program geared primarily toward beginning level of that issue. Speaker 0: No, we offer seven different levels ranging from true beginners, people who know absolutely nothing about Spanish all the way up through advanced and literature levels. So we have something for everybody. When you arrive, we would give you a placement test. It's a two-part test. The first part is written and it would test you on present tense, direct and indirect objects, goes all the way up to subjunctive and then you actually do some writing as well. And after an instructor would grade that, then they would speak with you and that would be the second portion of the test. They would ask you a lot of questions about why you're here studying Spanish, where you're from, why are you interested in Spanish in particular as opposed to some other language, have you visited other places within Mexico and whatnot. They're really zeroing in how you use the language when you're speaking. Speaker 1: And that helped them to more fine tune where they place you. Oh I see. And how many people are in each group? Maximum. Speaker 0: According to our brochures, 10, although we have never had a group of 10, average is more around 6 and it can be lower. Speaker 1: We've had groups of one before. I don't think that's a group. And how long is the program? Speaker 0: It's designed to last four weeks, but students can come by the week if they wish. We advise if they do come by the week that they try to come at the beginning of the session so they don't have instructional gaps. You know, for example, if the class is going on three weeks and then we suddenly have a student arrive at the end of the second or third week, it can be a little bit difficult and that student will enter into a class and spend in session already two or three weeks. We frequently, though, do have students who don't arrive at the beginning because their schedules don't allow them to have conformity to our schedule. And they do it. I have been a student here several times myself. I'm now the assistant director. And when I first came, I came the last two weeks of the December session and the first two weeks of the January session. And it was doable. It was difficult the last two weeks, but I did it. It was the only time I had to operate with. So it was all right. And then, of course, the January session, when I started with the rest of the group at the beginning of the session, was more easy to feel the flow of the class right away because the ground rules were there. Speaker 1: and for another thing. Uh-huh. And are you commenting on this? Speaker 0: patients there on premises or? No. We offer several options. The vast majority of residents take host family homes as the way to go when they're here in Wahaka. They pay a base price of $11 a day, and that includes a private room and full breakfast. And it may or may not include a private bath. It really depends on each family. We tell the students that it's not a hotel. It's a home. And the idea isn't so much for luxury. It's more for really communicating with people and getting to know the culture by way of the people. And the vast majority of the homes are upper middle class to lower upper class, the very nice homes and the families that we've worked with for years. If a student wishes other meals with the host family, for an additional $4 a day, the student can have Comita, which is the large midday meal. And you can eat very, very well in Wahaka on $4. But the $4 meal would be primarily for the purposes of interacting with the host family. And then there's the Saina, which is the very light, very late evening meal. That's anywhere between 7, 30, 9 o'clock at night. That's an additional $2. It can be as simple as Pando, Sai, and a cup of hot chocolate. And it's not formal. Speaker 1: I'm formal mail the way that the scene is. Would it be possible to come Speaker 0: may be vegetarian? Oh yeah we do that all the time. We're very used to it. Especially here in Wahaka, well in Mexico in general with tortillas and beans and all the wealth of fruits and vegetables that would be very simple. If students don't want to home stay and they wish to have alternative accommodations we can help with apartments and hotels and that sort of thing. They would need to send a deposit. But a lot of people when they call us they don't really speak enough. Speaker 1: They don't feel comfortable enough with their Spanish to make reservations. Are there hotels close by? Lots, yeah. Okay. The S is that you offer workshops and cooking as well. And weaving and pottery. And sometimes dance. Vocal or dance. And that's all incorporated into the program. Uh-huh. I see. And so, say I wanted to enroll in the beginning program. That would also be for six weeks, did you say? No four weeks. Four weeks, I say. Could you give me some ideas? Speaker 0: to what the price might be? Okay, the price is a $1-$50 registration fee and $400 for the session or $100 by the Speaker 1: a week or 100 by week. And do you have any more printed information on? We have a brochure. Speaker 0: Sure. Would it be possible to attend me one? Sure will. Speaker 1: Let me grab a piece of paper, hold on just one moment. Okay. Okay, my name is Richard Gannis. Good. You just got your last name? Yeah, it's G-A-N-I-S. Speaker 0: G-A-N-I-S. Right. Okay. I thought I heard an F. Speaker 1: there. Okay. Uh-huh. And my address is 16-02-HERSC Avenue H-E-A-R-S-P. HERSC Avenue in Berkeley, California. Speaker 0: I can't believe it's my grandmother lived on her stavino for years. Speaker 1: Oh really? There's now a park there, a long, long park they've been demolished. Yeah, a lovely park right there. Demolished. Her house which is too bad. Which is it? And it's 9-4-703. Okay. Yeah, I've been rid of the question of the park there. Speaker 0: Yeah, there was a railroad tracks or something that were there and I remember playing there when we visited it a couple of times when I was a child that went back for the first time in years, just about two years ago and was done to see that the house was Speaker 1: Completely gone and there was a park in this place. It's like a dog park now. They let the dogs run there. Yeah. Speaker 0: I'm going to repeat this address back to make sure that I've got it right. Okay. I've got Richard Gannis, GANIS, 1602 Hurst Avenue, AGEARST, Berkeley, California, 94703. Right. Speaker 1: Okay, well I'll get this up to you today. Great, I appreciate that. Well you're welcome. And I appreciate you letting this call be recorded as well. That's fine. Okay, thanks very much. Bye-bye. Goodbye.\""

       "\"Speaker 1: Okay, I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about the program. What exactly goes on? Speaker 0: Okay, well basically it's an intensive program designed to last four weeks. Each session is four weeks long, although we do have two sessions in 1996 that will be two weeks long. But our general four week session involves seven hours of contact each day of Spanish. It involves starting at nine o'clock in the morning with three hours of grammar instruction. And then it's followed immediately by an hour of group conversation with the same instructor, same class. But we have extensive gardens here at the Institute and so students will usually go out to a garden setting because it's a little more comfortable. And then after a break for lunch, students return and we have a complete flip of instruction in that instead of textbook and clinical type instruction, we have hands on. And we offer workshops in Mehe Backstrap leaving regional cooking of Wahaka at Don Pasnell pottery. And if we have large groups, we also offer folkloric dance. And those are two hours a day Monday through Thursday. And they're really in place not so much to teach students a craft, but they're in place to facilitate Spanish language acquisition with a hands-on project. It's our belief that using the language will give students an opportunity to have better retention. You say they use it, they feel a little bit more comfortable, the vocabulary expands and whatnot. And then the last hour is a daily intercombo hour and that's where someone from the community in Wahaka comes to the Institute. They work with one of our students, one-on-one as a conversation partner. And if the students here at the Institute were English speaking, English being their native language, then half the time would be in English, half the time would be in Spanish. And we offer included in the course our lectures, weekly lectures, and we have films and other cultural presentations. And all that is included within the same package. We also offer optional tours on the weekends, going to points of interest around Wahaka. Wahaka, I don't know if you're familiar with Wahaka, but it's really rich with archaeological sites and indigenous marketplaces and craft villages. Speaker 1: There's a lot to see. There's a program geared primarily toward beginning level of that issue. Speaker 0: No, we offer seven different levels ranging from true beginners, people who know absolutely nothing about Spanish all the way up through advanced and literature levels. So we have something for everybody. When you arrive, we would give you a placement test. It's a two-part test. The first part is written and it would test you on present tense, direct and indirect objects, goes all the way up to subjunctive and then you actually do some writing as well. And after an instructor would grade that, then they would speak with you and that would be the second portion of the test. They would ask you a lot of questions about why you're here studying Spanish, where you're from, why are you interested in Spanish in particular as opposed to some other language, have you visited other places within Mexico and whatnot. They're really zeroing in how you use the language when you're speaking. Speaker 1: And that helped them to more fine tune where they place you. Oh I see. And how many people are in each group? Maximum. Speaker 0: According to our brochures, 10, although we have never had a group of 10, average is more around 6 and it can be lower. Speaker 1: We've had groups of one before. I don't think that's a group. And how long is the program? Speaker 0: It's designed to last four weeks, but students can come by the week if they wish. We advise if they do come by the week that they try to come at the beginning of the session so they don't have instructional gaps. You know, for example, if the class is going on three weeks and then we suddenly have a student arrive at the end of the second or third week, it can be a little bit difficult and that student will enter into a class and spend in session already two or three weeks. We frequently, though, do have students who don't arrive at the beginning because their schedules don't allow them to have conformity to our schedule. And they do it. I have been a student here several times myself. I'm now the assistant director. And when I first came, I came the last two weeks of the December session and the first two weeks of the January session. And it was doable. It was difficult the last two weeks, but I did it. It was the only time I had to operate with. So it was all right. And then, of course, the January session, when I started with the rest of the group at the beginning of the session, was more easy to feel the flow of the class right away because the ground rules were there. Speaker 1: and for another thing. Uh-huh. And are you commenting on this? Speaker 0: patients there on premises or? No. We offer several options. The vast majority of residents take host family homes as the way to go when they're here in Wahaka. They pay a base price of $11 a day, and that includes a private room and full breakfast. And it may or may not include a private bath. It really depends on each family. We tell the students that it's not a hotel. It's a home. And the idea isn't so much for luxury. It's more for really communicating with people and getting to know the culture by way of the people. And the vast majority of the homes are upper middle class to lower upper class, the very nice homes and the families that we've worked with for years. If a student wishes other meals with the host family, for an additional $4 a day, the student can have Comita, which is the large midday meal. And you can eat very, very well in Wahaka on $4. But the $4 meal would be primarily for the purposes of interacting with the host family. And then there's the Saina, which is the very light, very late evening meal. That's anywhere between 7, 30, 9 o'clock at night. That's an additional $2. It can be as simple as Pando, Sai, and a cup of hot chocolate. And it's not formal. Speaker 1: I'm formal mail the way that the scene is. Would it be possible to come Speaker 0: may be vegetarian? Oh yeah we do that all the time. We're very used to it. Especially here in Wahaka, well in Mexico in general with tortillas and beans and all the wealth of fruits and vegetables that would be very simple. If students don't want to home stay and they wish to have alternative accommodations we can help with apartments and hotels and that sort of thing. They would need to send a deposit. But a lot of people when they call us they don't really speak enough. Speaker 1: They don't feel comfortable enough with their Spanish to make reservations. Are there hotels close by? Lots, yeah. Okay. The S is that you offer workshops and cooking as well. And weaving and pottery. And sometimes dance. Vocal or dance. And that's all incorporated into the program. Uh-huh. I see. And so, say I wanted to enroll in the beginning program. That would also be for six weeks, did you say? No four weeks. Four weeks, I say. Could you give me some ideas? Speaker 0: to what the price might be? Okay, the price is a $1-$50 registration fee and $400 for the session or $100 by the Speaker 1: a week or 100 by week. And do you have any more printed information on? We have a brochure. Speaker 0: Sure. Would it be possible to attend me one? Sure will. Speaker 1: Let me grab a piece of paper, hold on just one moment. Okay. Okay, my name is Richard Gannis. Good. You just got your last name? Yeah, it's G-A-N-I-S. Speaker 0: G-A-N-I-S. Right. Okay. I thought I heard an F. Speaker 1: there. Okay. Uh-huh. And my address is 16-02-HERSC Avenue H-E-A-R-S-P. HERSC Avenue in Berkeley, California. Speaker 0: I can't believe it's my grandmother lived on her stavino for years. Speaker 1: Oh really? There's now a park there, a long, long park they've been demolished. Yeah, a lovely park right there. Demolished. Her house which is too bad. Which is it? And it's 9-4-703. Okay. Yeah, I've been rid of the question of the park there. Speaker 0: Yeah, there was a railroad tracks or something that were there and I remember playing there when we visited it a couple of times when I was a child that went back for the first time in years, just about two years ago and was done to see that the house was Speaker 1: Completely gone and there was a park in this place. It's like a dog park now. They let the dogs run there. Yeah. Speaker 0: I'm going to repeat this address back to make sure that I've got it right. Okay. I've got Richard Gannis, GANIS, 1602 Hurst Avenue, AGEARST, Berkeley, California, 94703. Right. Speaker 1: Okay, well I'll get this up to you today. Great, I appreciate that. Well you're welcome. And I appreciate you letting this call be recorded as well. That's fine. Okay, thanks very much. Bye-bye. Goodbye. \""
